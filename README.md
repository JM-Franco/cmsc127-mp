<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

The web application will essentially be a platform for its users to share recipes with each other as well as to plan meals for a week. There will be two expected types of users of the web application: the UNREGISTERED USERS and REGISTERED USERS, 

<ol type="A">
	<li><strong>UNREGISTERED USERS</strong> are users who access the web application without being logged in an account. Some of the functionalities of the web application 	that they have access to are as follows:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>Search for a recipe with filter
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        				<li>
            					They can search for a specific dish and the web application will find a recipe for them.
					</li>
            				<li>
            					The search can be filtered by dish type  (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, main course, appetizer, etc.)
            				</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Register for an account
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
					<li>
						The following information are asked of the user to register for an account: username (optional), name, email address, password, country.
					</li>
				</ol>
         		</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
 	<li><strong>REGISTERED USERS</strong> are users who access the web application while being logged in an account.
 		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>Search for a recipe with filter
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
        				<li>
						Similar to UNREGISTERED USERS, they can also search for recipes with filters but with added functionality: They can search just by listing ingredients and the web application will search for recipes that contain the listed ingredients.
					</li>
        			</ol>
        		</li>
			<li>Save a list of their favorite recipes
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            				<li>It may contain a search and filter function.</li>
            			</ol>
         		</li>
         		<li>Publish own recipes
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            				<li>They can contribute their own recipes containing the following possible details: name of the dish, image of the dish, dish type, ingredients, and utensils that are necessary.
					</li>
            			</ol>
         		</li>
         		<li>Remove published recipes
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            				<li>
						They can delete recipes that they published
					</li>
            			</ol>
         		</li>
         		<li>Create a meal plan for a week
        			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            				<li>
					Grouping of various dishes and assigning them as breakfast, lunch, or dinner on different days of the week.
					</li>
            			</ol>
        		 </li>
         		<li>Update their account details</li>
         		<li>Deactivate their account</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
